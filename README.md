UML2CPP
=======

This is an automatic C++ code generation implementated based on Acceleo. It gets a model which is a ".uml" file and generates codes for classes, attributes, methods, associations, and state machines. It keeps the package hierarchy, generate set and get methods, the necessary APIs for associations, and finally a fast code based on switches for state machines.
